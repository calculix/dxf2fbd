2D AutoCAD DXF to CalculiX GraphiX FBD converters

hi,

i make a tool utilities, a converter of 2D AutoCAD **DXF** to CalculiX GraphiX **FBD** files called **dxf2fbd**. this small code modification and adaptation are based on works of David Colignon from GMSH source codes.

current features:
<ul>
  <li>support lines, arch & circle objects</li>
<li>a circle will be split automatically to four arch objects</li>
<li>Z-offset to place at some elevation</li>
<li>merge coincident nodes with a coordinate tolerances</li>
<li>remove duplicated object in the same position</li>

Hopes it will be useful to create base of geometry to extrude or revolve in making of three dimensional models.

thank you for interest,
